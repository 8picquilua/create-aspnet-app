Facebook Password Decryptor is a free and easy-to-use application that you can download from Softpedia[^1^]. It does not require installation or administrator privileges. You just need to run the executable file and click on the Start Recovery button. The tool will scan your system and display the list of web browsers and the corresponding Facebook passwords. You can then copy the password to the clipboard or save it as a text file.
 
Facebook Password Decryptor is a useful tool for recovering your Facebook password, but it also has some limitations. It can only recover the password that is currently stored by your web browser. If you have changed your password recently or logged out from your account, the tool may not be able to retrieve it. Also, the tool may not work if you have enabled two-factor authentication or other security features on your Facebook account.
 
Therefore, you should always keep your Facebook password in a safe place and use a strong and unique password for your account. You should also avoid using public or shared computers to access your Facebook account, as they may expose your password to hackers or malware. If you suspect that your account has been compromised, you should change your password immediately and review your security settings.

How does Facebook Password Decryptor work? Facebook Password Decryptor uses a technique called password extraction to recover your Facebook password. This technique involves reading the encrypted password stored by your web browser and decrypting it using a secret key. The secret key is usually derived from the user name, the domain name, or other information related to the web browser.
 
Facebook Password Decryptor supports most of the popular web browsers that use different encryption algorithms and storage formats for passwords. For example, Chrome and Opera use AES encryption and store the passwords in a SQLite database file. Firefox uses 3DES encryption and stores the passwords in a JSON file. Internet Explorer and Safari use DPAPI encryption and store the passwords in the Windows registry or a plist file.
 
Facebook Password Decryptor can automatically detect the web browser installed on your system and locate the password file. It can then extract the encrypted password and decrypt it using the appropriate key. The tool can also handle multiple Facebook accounts stored by the same web browser. You can see the user name, password, and profile URL of each account in the tool's interface.

Is Facebook Password Decryptor safe and legal? Facebook Password Decryptor is a legitimate tool that can help you recover your own Facebook password in case you forget it or lose access to your account. It does not hack or crack any Facebook account or password. It only works on your local system and does not send any data to any remote server. It also does not contain any malware or spyware that can harm your system or privacy.
 
However, you should be careful when using Facebook Password Decryptor or any other password recovery tool. You should only use it for your own account and not for any other person's account without their permission. You should also make sure that you download the tool from a trusted source and scan it with an antivirus program before running it. You should also delete the tool and the password file after you recover your password.
 
Using Facebook Password Decryptor or any other password recovery tool may violate the terms of service of Facebook or other websites. You should read and understand the terms of service before using any such tool. You should also respect the privacy and security of other users and not misuse any password that you recover. You are solely responsible for any consequences that may arise from using Facebook Password Decryptor or any other password recovery tool.
